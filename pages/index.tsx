                them in order help Vitalus reach its full potential. The Vitalus Job Board will be a place for 
                community members to offer and request specific services from other members. Those who help out will 
                receive MV coins or other rewards for their services.

                Services can be simple like creating a graphic to post on our social accounts, or more complex
                helping another Vitalian file their taxes... The idea here is that just about anything that 2 
                people can agree on can be rewarded. We want the Vitalus community to thrive both socially and
                economically, and we will do what we can to facilitate this goal.
